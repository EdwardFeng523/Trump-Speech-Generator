# Trump-Speech-Generator
This project makes use of markov model and a huge data set of Trump's speech to randomly generate a sentence that sounds like something Trump said. To play with this project, we need to type a word as the input and the project will generate a very "Trumpified" sentence that contains this word. 

Open the python file and scroll down to the final line of code, call the "run" function with a input string of word and an integer 1, you'll see the generated sentence.
